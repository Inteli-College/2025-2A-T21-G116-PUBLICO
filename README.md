## 🎯 About the Project

**Escolarizei** is a comprehensive financial intelligence platform designed specifically for K-12 private schools in Brazil. The platform addresses the critical challenge of manual tuition collection processes by providing an integrated solution that combines:

- 💳 **Digital payment rails** (Pix, bank slips)
- 💬 **Direct WhatsApp communication** with parents/guardians
- 📊 **AI-powered financial intelligence** and real-time dashboards
- 🤖 **End-to-end automation** of the collection process

This project is being developed as part of the **Instituto de Tecnologia e Liderança (Inteli)** academic program, focusing on solving real-world problems through technology and innovation.

## 🔍 Problem Statement

### The Challenge

Many K-12 schools in Brazil face significant challenges with tuition collection:

- **📝 Manual & bureaucratic processes** - Spreadsheets, manual tracking, disconnected systems
- **💸 High delinquency rates** - 6-15% of students regularly late on payments
- **⏰ Time-consuming operations** - 20+ hours/month dedicated to collections per school
- **📉 Cash flow unpredictability** - Schools can't forecast incoming revenue accurately
- **😤 Parent/guardian friction** - Complaints about payment difficulties and communication issues
- **👥 Team overload** - Multiple staff members (3-5) involved in collection processes

### Validated Pain Points

Through our market research, we've confirmed:

| Pain Point | Impact | Evidence |
|------------|--------|----------|
| Manual collection processes | High | 20+ hours/month, 3-5 people involved |
| High delinquency rates | High | 6-15% of students consistently late |
| Cash flow unpredictability | Critical | "Never know how much will come in" |
| Parent complaints | Medium | Multiple communication and payment issues |
| Technology fragmentation | Medium | Disconnected tools and systems |
